Travel Experiences:
I love to travel. Some of my favorite travel experiences were
when my dad took my sister and I on a cruise to Alaska. Alaska usually has
something like 300+ days of rain a year. Our 7 day cruise only
had 1 rainy day. It's beautiful up there.

Another experience that I enjoyed was going to Germany
on a business trip. We were there for about 10 days but
unfortunately I was not able to do much sight-seeing.
I quickly learned I am a spoiled America. Germans have a
much different idea of breakfast. I definitely didn't find
any cereals or french toast or any of the sweet, sugar
breakfast stuff we are used to here in the states. Their
idea of breakfast (as was served at the hotel) was cold
meats, cheese, and slices of bread.
